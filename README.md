FSharp.Euler.Problems
=====================

Learning F# by solving [Euler Problems](http://projecteuler.net/).

I am aware of much better solutions to Euler problems can be found on net ([Did it with .NET](http://diditwith.net/) or [theburningmonk.com](http://theburningmonk.com/)).
but I just learn by doing, not reading :).
